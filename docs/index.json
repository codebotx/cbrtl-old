[{"content":"What is cbrtl? cbrtl is an attempt at creating a tight knit group of programmers who like making fun stuff and being involved in Open Source development. We are based out of Silicon Institute of Technology, Odisha.\nWhat do we do here? A lot of stuff, actually!\n Create fun and unique projects. Either in groups or in isolation. Organize community and online showcases for group and individual projects. Contribute to Open Source projects both in cbrtl and in other communities. Conduct code reviews and JAMs. Share lesser known resources to learn. Write blog posts about the eccentricities of everyday software. Ones that you wish you\u0026rsquo;d have found when starting out.  What is the end goal? Merely to promote Open Source culture and proper software development within our college.\nWhere does cbrtl operate from? Primarily, we are a bunch of students from Silicon Institute of Technology, Odisha. The idea has been to promote the spirit of open source among our students. That said, we are always open to having new members from anywhere.\nHow far down the road are we? Not that far, the egg has just been laid. As of the time of writing this post, we have just started out. Remember that cbrtl is an attempt at creating a place for people to forge software. For the effort to work out, we are looking for active participation from you.\nWhat can I do? Just what you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing so far, but with more people!\nIf you have projects that you have already been working on, let us know and we\u0026rsquo;ll put them on the cbrtl page for more people to see. Note that there is some criteria that projects must qualify, some of these are intentionally vague. But as long as you\u0026rsquo;re doing more than following a course or tutorial, it\u0026rsquo;s most likely going to be accepted :)\nVolunteering to cbrtl We are looking for volunteers for some roles. Note however, that there is no strict mandate for responsibilities. As long as you\u0026rsquo;re capable of adding something of value, no matter how small, shoot us a message! We\u0026rsquo;re looking for some help with:\n  Code reviewers: If you have experience contributing to FOSS or writing code for user/developer facing products, perhaps you can volunteer and help us out here :)\n  Editors: We plan on writing frequent blog posts. But both the technical content and the english material can use a second pair of eyes to help catch mistakes or inconsistent writing. If you have done some technical writing before, you can volunteer for reviewing the content in blog posts!\n  Technical Writers: If you have experience writing code but are usually on a tight schedule, you may be able to join us and share your knowledge. We want to mandate a high quality in our posts, so any tutorial/how-to guide that has been done a million times before is generally discouraged. We want to avoid redundant topics like \u0026ldquo;How to build a todo app with React\u0026rdquo; and promote posts and dev-logs / journals that are fun to read and explore.\n  Frontend devs: Currently, the cbrtl website is bland and not-so-catchy. While minimalism is the core idea, we can definitely use some front-end developers to help keep the UI fresh, responsive and modern.\n  Moderators: To help keep the community together on discord and github.\n  NOTE We do not expect any level of time commitment from volunteers, as long as you can make small contributions, we appreciate it. That is what volunteering is after all :)\nThe kind of software we want to write We firmly believe in re-inventing the wheel. Writing software close to the metal helps us closely understand the inner workings of tools we use everyday and take for granted. While any creative project is welcome, here are some ideas that adhere to the aforementioned:\n Compilers Virtual Machines and Interpreters Game Engines Operating Systems Search Engines Database engines Voxel renderers TCP/IP stack VCS  In short, we encourage all kinds of creative projects no matter how basic. But you can expect the above group projects to come to life as the community grows. Remember that all of the above is also regular software that we tend to take for granted which can be (and has been) written from scratch.\nShowcasing your project This post has something to say about project showcases, so you can go read up on that. If you want to showcase your project on our github org, then reach out to us on discord or the mailing list :)\n","permalink":"https://cbrtl.github.io/posts/what-and-why/","summary":"What is cbrtl? cbrtl is an attempt at creating a tight knit group of programmers who like making fun stuff and being involved in Open Source development.

Zuzu converts all your markdown files into static htmls pages to be rendered quickly. It uses Github falvoured Markdown CSS and highlight js to beautify code snippets. This blog, for example, has been written using this generator. This enables noobs like me to write blogs without having to learn a lot of code! It is a very simple and easy to use generator. All you need to do is to write a markdown file and it will be rendered as a page ;) You can create a new page by creating a new markdown file.\nHow does it work ? Zuzu parses the markdown file using javascript and renders it as html documents. It then saves the html files in the public folder. The public folder, with index.html file, is the final output of the generator and this can be deployed and hosted in various platforms. This particular blog has been deployed on Github Pages.\n1. Create a markdown file # This is a title This is a paragraph This is another paragraph This is a list: * Item 1 * Item 2 * Item 3 This is a code block: ``` print(\u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;) ``` This is a table: | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | | -------- | -------- | -------- | | 1 | 2 | 3 | | 4 | 5 | 6 | | 7 | 8 | 9 | This is a link: [zuzu](https://anubhavp.me/blog/zuzu.html)  2. Run the generator and find your blog Run npm run generate in the console. You\u0026rsquo;ll now see the blog in the public folder! Run the index.html file in your browser to see your blog. You may now deploy your site to a server.\nThe Static Site Generator 1. Libraries used  MarkdownIt Markdown parser done right. MarkdownItAnchor Header anchors for markdown-it. Glob \u0026ldquo;Globs\u0026rdquo; are the patterns you type when you do stuff like ls .js on the command line, or put build/ in a .gitignore file. Gray-Matter Parse front-matter from a string or file. Mkdirp Create Dirs if they do not exist.  2. Workflow This is the code for the generator.js. The code works in the following way:\n fs.readfile() from fs reads all the files from the said directory and stores then in filename using glob. It is a glob that matches all the files in the directory. The file system module allows you to work with the file system on your computer. gray-matter helps extracting front matter from the a string or file. Converts a string with front-matter, like this:   title: Hello slug: home --- \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello world!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; Into an object like this:\n{ content: '\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello world!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;', data: { title: 'Hello', slug: 'home' } }  It then extracts the front matter and stores it in data. It then stores the content in content and returns the filename to the main() function. It then repeats the process for all the files in the directory.\n The main() function then takes in one filename at a time and then parses it through markdownit( ,{markdownitanchor}). markdownit parses the file and converts the markdown content into HTML files. It then creates a html file and writes the parsed content into it. It then saves the html file in the public folder. This process repeats for all the files in the directory.\n  The converted html files are stored in the specified directories then using mkdirp. The index.html file isalready present in the public folder. mkdirp creates the directories if they do not exist.\n  3.

Programmers familiar with Lua/Javascript can pick up the language within an hour. Vyse also comes with a C++ API for frictionless embedding in projects.\nTable of Contents  Vyse  Table of Contents Goal Overview Roadmap Implementation  Lexing / Tokenizing (Source string -\u0026gt; Token) Compiling (Tokens -\u0026gt; Bytecode) VyVM     Building Benchmarks Tests Editor-Support Development  Goal Vyse aims to pick up after the Lua programming language, by adding popularly desired features on top of it, whilst providing similar speed and minimalism as Lua. There exist some quirks in Lua that Vyse aims to change.\n  Variables are global by default\n  Long keywords like local and the use of do .. end to designate blocks instead of {} makes it unlikeable to programmers coming from C.\n  The concept of metatables and metamethods is somewhat unintuitive to new programmers.\n  Tables being used as both arrays and maps can have unwanted side effects.\n  Lacks many features that are common in other languages such as :\n Compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=) and decrement and increment operators (++, --) . continue statement for skipping over some loop iterations. switch statements.    Arrays starting at 1 is a a minor issue to some.\n  Vyse aims to keep most of what Lua provides, but address the aforementioned issues and offer the following QoL feautures:\n A Familiar syntax for programmers migrating from Javascript and C An easy to integrate C++ API for easy embedding in applications Syntactic sugar for JS like OOP that boils down to the very same metatable and metamethod heirarchy.  Overview Here is a rough overview of the language\u0026rsquo;s syntax and features:\n-- importing modules is done with the builtin \u0026#39;import\u0026#39; function const math = import(\u0026#34;math\u0026#34;)  -- variable declaration and assignment const PI = math.pi -- variables declared with const are immutable let radius = 10  -- Function declaration fn calculate_area(r) {  return PI * r ** 2 -- \u0026#39;**\u0026#39; operator is used for exponentiation. }  let area = calculate_area(radius) -- function calling  -- constructing objects is very similar to Javascript.  let goblin = {  name: \u0026#34;Bobo\u0026#34;,  health: 12,  damage: 4,  attack(target) {  target.health -= this.damage \tprint(\u0026#34;Goblin attacks!\u0026#34;)  }, };  -- methods is done with the `:` operator. let wolf = { health: 20 } goblin:attack(wolf)  -- Arrays are intuitive too let numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]  -- the \u0026#39;#\u0026#39; operator returns length of lists or strings. print(\u0026#39;I have \u0026#39; .. #numbers .. \u0026#39;numbers!\u0026#39;) // \u0026#39;..\u0026#39; is the concat operator  -- the `\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;` operator can be used to push to arrays numbers \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; 10 \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; 11  -- looping is very similar to lua. for i = 1, #numbers { \tprint(numbers[i]) }   -- conditionals math.randseed(time.now()); const number = math.random(0, 100);  let guess = input():to_number(); -- read user input and parse as a number  while true { \tif guess \u0026lt; number { \tprint(\u0026#34;Too low! Try higher\u0026#34;) \t} else if guess \u0026gt; number { \tprint(\u0026#34;Too hight! Guess lower\u0026#34;) \t} else { \tprint(\u0026#34;You guessed it! The number was \u0026#34; .. number); \tbreak \t} } For a more complete spec of the language, and all it\u0026rsquo;s features visit manual.md. Alternatively, read the documentation on this page.\nRoadmap Currently, vyse supports basic control flow, variable declaration, usage and basic collection data structures. To move towards a more complete implementation, the following tasks have to be attended to:\n Implement parent tables (metatables in Lua). (DONE) Add a complete list of collection types (Arrays and tables). (DONE) Implement proper error reporting in all the passes. (DONE) Full support for Lambdas and closures. (DONE) Optimze value representation to optionally NaN boxed values. Optimize the garbage collector for incremental collection. Optimize the VM\u0026rsquo;s loop-dispatch to computed jumps. Add more compiler passes for better optimization.  Implementation Vyse runs on the Vyse Virtual Machine (svm for short). The VM has a stack based architechture that operates on 1 byte long opcodes. To keep the implementation concise and simple, vyse uses a single pass compiler that directly consumes tokens and emits bytecode.\nThe stages involved are :\nLexing / Tokenizing (Source string -\u0026gt; Token) The vyse lexer resides in the include/scanner.hpp file, A simple hand written lexer that accepts a string returns a token whenever the method next_token() is called. The Lexer is called from within the Compiler, but can also be instantiated and used stand-alone for testing purposes.\nCompiling (Tokens -\u0026gt; Bytecode) The Compiler compiles tokens to Bytecode following the Vyse Bytecode Instruction format (include/x_opcode.hpp). Every instruction is 1 byte long. The compiler returns a function containing all the bytecode from the script, which is then loaded into the VM and called.\nVyVM The design of the VyVM is very similar to the Lua Virtual Machine despite the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s Stack based as opposed to LuaVM\u0026rsquo;s register based design (after version 5.1). It consists of a value stack and an accumulator register. It has full support for lambdas and closures following Lua\u0026rsquo;s upvalue design.\nBuilding To build vyse from source, it is recommended that you use CMake (version 3.13 or higher). The build tool used here is Ninja, but you can use any other build tool of your preference (eg- 'Unix Makefiles').\nAfter downloading/cloning vyse into a directory, cd into it and run the following commands to run the tests:\nmkdir build cd build cmake .. -G Ninja -DBUILD_TESTS=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DSTRESS_GC=true -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ninja ./vy \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt; The CMake script accepts some options, namely:\n   Option Values Description     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release/Debug Compilation mode for the C++ compiler. Also enables runtime assertions.   -DBUILD_TESTS true/false Whether to build the test suite.   -DSTRESS_GC true/false When true, runs the garbage collector whenever possible. Useful for catching GC bugs.   -DLOG_GC true/false When true, logs the GC status on every cycle.   -DLOG_DISASM true/false When true, dumps the bytecode disassembly of every program after the compiler pass, before running it on the VM    Note that -CMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ are optional, and you can use any C++ compiler toolchain of your liking. The aforementioned snippet will build the project in debug mode, which is preferred for development but is much, much slower.\nFor an optimized release build, use:\ncmake .. -G Ninja -DBUILD_TESTS=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSTRESS_GC=false -DLOG_GC=false -DLOG_DISASM=false Benchmarks The benchmarks for vyuse are present in the benchmark directory. The benchmark/run.py script can be used to compare Vyse against other languages. You can either run all benchmarks, or run specific benchmarks.\nFirst, create and activate a virtual environment:\ncd benchmarks python3 -m venv env source env/bin/activate Then, install all the dependencies inside the virtual environment:\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt To run all benchmarks, enter the following into your shell:\ncd benchmarks python3 run.py To run, a specific benchmark, use the --bench option:\npython3 run.py --bench=fib Tests For testing, the ctest utility is used along with some hand written helper headers. To run existing tests, run ctest inside the build directory (bin or out). Tests of all kinds can be found under the test directory.\n\n(Note: time is in seconds)\nIf your terminal does not have ASNI support, or you want to pipe the benchmarks to a file for reporting, then you can use the --nocolor flag.\nEditor-Support Currently, syntax highlighting and code completion snippets are supported on the following code editors:\n VS Code Sublime text [In Progress] Vim [Coming soon] Atom [Coming soon]  Development If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to contribute to vyse, It is recommended to have clang-format for formatting and clangd language server for your text editor. On VSCode, the C/C++ extension can be used to debug the executable. Alternatively, you can use GDC/LLDB or other debuggers to your liking.\nThe sources are in src/ while the public headers are in include/. A basic CLI module is present under cli/.\n","permalink":"https://cbrtl.github.io/posts/vyse/","summary":"Vyse  Vyse An elegant and embeddable programming language Visit the language spec » Website »  Report Bug • Request Feature CI Status [MIT License](https://github.com/tterb/atomic-design-ui/blob/master/LICENSEs)\nVyse is a dynamically typed, interpreted and fast scriptling language inspired by Lua for rapid prototyping of applications like video games.

The voluntary sector has always played an important role in supporting the government as a partner in nation-building and is heavily funded by the government as well as by private institutions. In 2018 only, companies contributed US$1 Billion to CSR initiatives, according to a survey.\nConsidering the vast impact and significance of the sector, it becomes very important to tackle the challenges present here as well as to improve and increase its accessibility.\nWe have noticed two major problems in this sector:\n The credibility of NGOs is a major concern for fund donors especially Government and Corporate Institutions. No easy way exists for the general public to find reliable local NGOs and volunteer for them.  With the vision to tackle both the problems together, we propose a solution called Ratenect.\nRatenect is a web/mobile platform with a two-way rating system. The workflow of Ratenect is depicted by the illustration below:\n\nWhat will the interface look like? For the start, we have to keep things simple and eventually we shall ramp up the platform. The simple web/mobile interface will be as:\n  For NGOS:  Sign up and login pages. An account page, where there will be overview volunteers applied, donations received through this platform, and the option to update their details. An applications page, where they can see the details of the volunteers applied and can accept and reject the applications. A donations page, where they can see details of donations. A page to make public posts about their work for which they need volunteers to lend help. A feeds page where they can see other NGOs posts.    For Volunteers:  Sign up and login pages. An account page where there will be an overview of their own work, account details, updating details option. A feed (landing page) where they can see the NGOs available nearby them, a search bar through which NGOs can be searched based on location entered. When they can click on an NGO name, they can see the complete details of the NGO, its posts, location and click on the \u0026lsquo;Apply\u0026rsquo; button to express their interest to volunteer.

Forming teams for hackathons and CP events. Collaborating on projects together. Showcasing projects from individuals and teams. Code reviews and educational blogs (ones that haven\u0026rsquo;t been done to death before\u0026hellip;).  What platforms are you present on? For now, our presence is limited to Discord and the GitHub organization. Mostly because these are very solid platforms and we are tight on the number of people moderating.\nWhat skills do I need? Not much.\n The ability to code. The willingness to learn. Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub.  Even 1 and 3 are optional.\nWhere do I join? As mentioned earlier, you can join the Discord and the GitHub organization. More info on Getting started with cbrtl and Open Source.\nIs there anything I can do to help? Yes. PayTM me some cash. ahem, you can volunteer to help us keep the community thriving. We are looking for volunteers who can help with:\n Front end development: To touch up the current blog site. Moderation: To manage the discord server and the GitHub org. Code reviews: To mandate some code quality for those who demand it. Technical Writers: To aid in writing blog posts. Editors: A second pair of eyes helps catch common mistakes in writing :)  Is this an official college club? Nope, not yet. This is an entirely independent student initiative that is looking for active participation. This is a mostly decentralized group of like-minded programmers.\nWill there be exciting cash prizes? No. I want to be upfront about it. Those of us who end up forming hackathon teams may earn some on their own, but we want to keep this community closeted to people who code because they like making fun stuff. Of course, that is not to say we discredit any other motivation you may have.\nAs such, we won\u0026rsquo;t conduct any competitions with cash prizes for the foreseeable future.

So anything along these lines is generally discouraged:  \u0026ldquo;todo app in react\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;planner app in vue\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;terminal tic-tac-toe with C\u0026rdquo; and so on\u0026hellip;   Is being actively worked on by it\u0026rsquo;s developer(s). It is OK even if it\u0026rsquo;s in infancy when the project is first showcased. Is open to contribution from people. Is not a lazy fork (Forks that are some-what different from the parent repos are absolutely okay).  If you cross out any projects that don\u0026rsquo;t match the above criteria, all that remains is an honest-to-god project that could use some publicity :)\nExamples Here\u0026rsquo;s a few examples to show what we mean by \u0026ldquo;showcase-able projects\u0026rdquo;. Note that not all of them are from the members of cbrtl, since we\u0026rsquo;re just getting started out.\n levk: A 3D Game engine written in C++ and Vulkan. Author: karnage SocioMark: A social media platform with plagiarism and attack-proof authenticity checks for user uploaded content. Author: Aitik Gupta vyse: A fast, dynamically typed and interpreted programming language. Author: srijan_ (cough self-plug) locc: A C++ utility to count lines of code in a project. Author: karnage lume: A Lua library for gamedev. Author: rxi  NOTE: Not all future project additions need to be nearly as complex as the projects listed above.\nBut there is a common running theme with these that you may have caught on to by now. All these projects are really cool but under-represented. That right there, is what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve.\nWe want your projects that you build individually or in teams, to get the recognized in a community and to get feedback from reviewers/users.\nGetting your project showcased. Wooookay, now we get to the point. You have made something, or at least the skeleton of something that will go on to become a full fledged project. How do you put your code and product on cbrtl? Heres how.\n Reach out to use either on the mailing list, or on the discord server Have the following ready:  A GitHub repo with a well set-up README A short/long write-up describing the scope, aim, tech-stack and architecture of your project. (Need not be serious at all)   Shoot any moderator with the aforementioned and we\u0026rsquo;ll give you:  A GitHub repo symlink (symlink?) on the cbrtl org page. A community showcase. A blog post referencing the content from your write-up, describing the project. Encourage other members to collaborate and contribute.    A good place to start getting involved can be our Discord server.\nHave an idea? Want a team? It is not so uncommon for programmers to get an idea but not have enough time commitment (or knowledge) to drive the idea to fruition. If that\u0026rsquo;s how things end up for you, then let us know about your ideas and we can see if enough members in the community are interested to collaborate.\nWe may be able to help turn your solo idea into a collaborative work environment. You can choose to have the repo be on the org, or on your GitHub profile.\nClosing with some general thoughts and other goals. In the future, we also want to create teams for Hackathons and Competitive Programming events (I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of the latter personally, but I understand people will have differing opinions).\nAs mentioned in the previous post, we are looking for some volunteers in content writing, editing, front-end dev, code reviews and moderation. If you have any other ideas in general that can help us grow, let us know :)\nReach out to us if you\u0026rsquo;re a programmer and want to join a community of people who like to create.\nWhat else do I say, we\u0026rsquo;re just getting started out after all.\nAdios.\n","permalink":"https://cbrtl.github.io/posts/project-showcase/","summary":"Helloo again.\nThis post intends to establish some minor ordinances surrounding project ideas and showcases. cbrtl was created with the intent of promoting the spirit of Open Source. Often times, some of the most interesting Open Source projects live in lesser known corners of GitHub, gathering dust on a lonesome profile with 3-5 followers and an occasionally active commit graph.\nWith cbrtl, we can shine some light on these pieces of software, benefitting both the creator/maintainer and the people who can use these projects as reference.","title":"Showcasing your project on cbrtl"},{"content":"So you read up on open source, read up on cbrtl and want to start hacking. There are some preliminaries that you should take care of first. I will list them in order:\n Create a GitHub account. Set up git on your local computer.  If you\u0026rsquo;re on windows, download GitBash and follow the install instructions. Get a personal test repo set up and try out commands like push, commit, pull etc.   Join the GitHub organization by adding yourself to the members list (More on that below). Join the Discord server.  Alright, you\u0026rsquo;re set to start out. At this point, I would recommend getting familiar with GitHub, reading up some articles and blogs. I highly recommend Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s git tutorials and documentation.\nMaking your first Pull Request (NOTE: If you have experience using git and don\u0026rsquo;t want to waste time, just ping the @cbrtl moderator role on discord and we\u0026rsquo;ll add you).\nIf you had to follow through the above, then it\u0026rsquo;s likely that you\u0026rsquo;ve never made a PR before. To get your feet wet, make your first PR on our member\u0026rsquo;s list repo. Once you do that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be recognized as a member of cbrtl on GitHub. You will find a step by step guide on how to do that on the repository\u0026rsquo;s README.\nDone? Great! 🎉\nNow you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to wait for a moderator to merge your PR. That should be done by the time you\u0026rsquo;re done reading this article ;)\nGetting the most out of it The way you grow and shape your journey into Open Source is dictated by your level of engagement with people, and participation in projects, discussions and the like. Now then, how do you define \u0026ldquo;engagement\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;participation\u0026rdquo;? It can mean different things for different people, but the recurring ideas are the same.\nWays to participate  Contributing to the blog. Part-taking in open source projects being built in the community. Coming up with your own project ideas, and getting people to contribute. Showcasing projects you have made on cbrtl blog and GitHub organization. Contributing to larger open source projects outside cbrtl. Asking questions, getting to know people better. Volunteering on development and content moderation. Details here  Starting your own project. It would be great to have more interesting projects available for people to work on. Look at the project showcase post for relevant information.\n","permalink":"https://cbrtl.github.io/posts/getting-started/","summary":"So you read up on open source, read up on cbrtl and want to start hacking.
