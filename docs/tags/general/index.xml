      <description>What is cbrtl? cbrtl is an attempt at creating a tight knit group of programmers who like making fun stuff and being involved in Open Source development. We are based out of Silicon Institute of Technology, Odisha.
What do we do here? A lot of stuff, actually!
Create fun and unique projects. Either in groups or in isolation. Organize community and online showcases for group and individual projects. Contribute to Open Source projects both in cbrtl and in other communities.</description>
