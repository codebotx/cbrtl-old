      <description>Helloo again.
This post intends to establish some minor ordinances surrounding project ideas and showcases. cbrtl was created with the intent of promoting the spirit of Open Source. Often times, some of the most interesting Open Source projects live in lesser known corners of GitHub, gathering dust on a lonesome profile with 3-5 followers and an occasionally active commit graph.
With cbrtl, we can shine some light on these pieces of software, benefitting both the creator/maintainer and the people who can use these projects as reference.</description>
