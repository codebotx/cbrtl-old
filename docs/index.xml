      <description>NOTE: This project is being maintained by Ankur Khandelwal
India has over 3.2 million registered NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisations) across its territory. The voluntary sector has always played an important role in supporting the government as a partner in nation-building and is heavily funded by the government as well as by private institutions. In 2018 only, companies contributed US$1 Billion to CSR initiatives, according to a survey.
Considering the vast impact and significance of the sector, it becomes very important to tackle the challenges present here as well as to improve and increase its accessibility.</description>

      <description>Why the weird name? It comes from the C stdlib function cbrtl.
But why does the C standard library have these weird names?
Well there is a little bit of trivia to it, in older versions of ANSI C, only the first 6 characters of an identifier were considered in the compiler. So most standard library functions in C have odd names like strstr, strtod, alloca and so on&amp;hellip;
Oh, and also because every other GitHub organization name was taken&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Showcasing your project on cbrtl</title>

      <description>Helloo again.
This post intends to establish some minor ordinances surrounding project ideas and showcases. cbrtl was created with the intent of promoting the spirit of Open Source. Often times, some of the most interesting Open Source projects live in lesser known corners of GitHub, gathering dust on a lonesome profile with 3-5 followers and an occasionally active commit graph.
With cbrtl, we can shine some light on these pieces of software, benefitting both the creator/maintainer and the people who can use these projects as reference.</description>

      <description>So you read up on open source, read up on cbrtl and want to start hacking. There are some preliminaries that you should take care of first. I will list them in order:
Create a GitHub account. Set up git on your local computer. If you&amp;rsquo;re on windows, download GitBash and follow the install instructions. Get a personal test repo set up and try out commands like push, commit, pull etc.</description>
